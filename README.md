# Dream-Visualizer

This Streamlit app uses **Google's Gemini AI** to interpret dreams, generate a surreal dream-inspired image, and suggest a **therapeutic music theme** turning your dream into a multimodal experience.


## Features

-  **Dream Interpretation:** Understand emotional and symbolic meanings using Gemini 1.5 Flash.
-  **Image Generation:** Get a surreal image based on your dream narrative.
-  **Therapeutic Music Prompt:** Receive a customized music description based on your dream for a calming experience.

## How It Works
1. **User types a dream** (e.g., "I was running through a forest being chased by shadows").
2. **AI responds with**:
   - Interpretation of the dream
   - AI-generated visual art
   - A music theme to represent the emotional tone of the dream
